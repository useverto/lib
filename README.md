## About

This repository contains all of the utilities to integrate Verto into your applications.

> Important Notice: Verto is in its Alpha stage. If you have a suggestion, idea, or find a bug, please report it! The Verto team will not be held accountable for any funds lost.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### NPM:

```sh
npm install @verto/lib
```

or

```sh
yarn add @verto/lib
```

#### OpenBits:

```sh
openbits install @verto/lib@0.1.0-alpha
```

#### Arweave:

```
npm install https://arweave.net/xNk-ABRVMAvgZ8wvdSUsvDZYT7yZnGilQM9Ucsu1py4
```

or

```
yarn add https://arweave.net/xNk-ABRVMAvgZ8wvdSUsvDZYT7yZnGilQM9Ucsu1py4
```

### Initialization

```js
import Verto from "@verto/lib";
import Arweave from "arweave";

const arweave = Arweave.init();
const client = new Verto(arweave);
```

You can alternatively initialize without a preconfigured Arweave Client.

```js
import Verto from "@verto/lib";

const client = new Verto();
```

If you are using the trade functions, you will need to intialise with a valid Arweave keyfile:

```js
import Verto from "@verto/lib";
import keyfile from "./arweave.json";

const client = new Verto(keyfile);
```
